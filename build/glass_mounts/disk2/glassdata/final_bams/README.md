## GLASS WORKFLOWS

### Docker image: glasstools:1.1.0


Tentative location where final, realinged bams will be populated.

**PS:** `final_bamdir_path` points here, i.e., `/mnt/glassdata/final_bams`. As of now, it is not being used in workflow and final bam files will be stored under sample-wise flowr directory under `/mnt/glassdata/flowr/` location.
