## GLASS WORKFLOWS

location to place fastq files and matching mapping_table.tsv file, e.g., for sampleX, create folder named sampleX under /mnt/disk2/glassdata/inputs/fqs/ and then place sampleX_mapping_table.tsv file at /mnt/disk2/glassdata/inputs/fqs/sampleX/sampleX_mapping_table.tsv

Filename of fastq files and not the full path should be written in the mapping table. Check out example mapping table at https://gist.github.com/sbamin/d86c9cd0b522a205fd128d266910a7cf
